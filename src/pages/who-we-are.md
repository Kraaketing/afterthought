# Who we are

Afterthought is a research studio for systemic change.  

We are a collective of senior impact researchers, strategists and facilitators, working to support ambitious organisations and changemakers who want to create systemic change through participatory research.  

As a studio we have a methodological commitment to spending more time with real people. We feel this has never been more important. To us this looks like extended research, deep-rooted ethnography and stepping beyond the focus group, interview or video call and into people’s day-to-day realities, for more than just an hour at a time.  

We do this because we know there is a difference between what people say, and what people do.  

Making research more embodied, and more reflective of true realities, means – to us – the centring of participatory methodologies that prioritise community voices and the lived experience. We continually work to find ways of making research less ‘extractive’ by nature.  

So, while we utilise traditional qualitative methodologies, we do not constrain ourselves to them either. We allow space for innovation, and outside-the-box approaches. What you get might surprise you, it might even shock you – but that’s the beauty of it – research that reveals true realities, rather than sanitising it.  

This is our commitment. 

## Why us? 

Independent impact researchers know how to get–things–done, and they are driven by what they do: but they can’t do it all alone.  

Afterthought cultivates an alternative: a trusted collective to call on for both partners, and collective members. This means flexible, tailor-to-fit teams built and led by our founder, minus the bloat of larger impact consultancies.  

You get to work with some of the most experienced impact researchers and strategists; they get to work on larger impact projects they may not otherwise have had access to.  

Shared commitment, shared accountability, and shared passion.
