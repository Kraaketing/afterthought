# What We Do

 

Afterthought works in a number of different ways: 

 

    We support the development of purpose-driven campaigns that connect with audiences by conducting audience deep dives 

    We build impact measurement frameworks to both judge and assess programmatic and organisational impact in the social sector  

    We help uncover the unsaid [things/feelings/opinions/perspectives people withhold in traditional research], and champion the unheard [groups neglected from traditional engagement] 

 

We specialise in participatory, peer-led, lived-experience research and we have a network of lived experience consultants to support this commitment.
