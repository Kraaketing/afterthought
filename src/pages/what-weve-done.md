# What we’ve done

Whether it’s facilitating community wellbeing research in deprived areas of London, assessing major humanitarian relief funds, or amplifying youth voices on issues like sexual health or junk food advertising, we maximise the power of research, for good.

Research projects we’ve worked on range from:

    -facilitating needs-based research for drug and alcohol users across the UK
    -assessing the impact and effectiveness of major humanitarian relief funds
    -exploring the sexual health needs of young women in foster care for new digital interventions
    -facilitating community wellbeing research in deprived areas of London for local councils
    -assessing the impact and effectiveness of mental health support services for vulnerable prisoners
    -understanding key socio-economic barriers to PrEP uptake amongst at-risk populations
    -testing campaigns highlighting the impact of junk food ads on young people for a youth-led charity
    -exploring community resilience and emergency preparedness in one of London’s most diverse boroughs
